Modeled after tixy-pounce and originaly [tixy.land](https://tixy.land/), code-mini-golf code-art using the "Pounce" programming language.

### Created with pounce-lang/simple-example-app starter kit 
The quick way to start using the Pounce programming language embedded in a web page.
Using the Pounce parser and interpreter from the npm package @pounce-lang/core.

## Uses Pounce (a Post-fix Concatenative Programming Language)
More information on "What Pounce is?", can be found [here](https://github.com/pounce-lang/core, but in short: Pounce is a "concatenative" languages (as opposed to "applicative"). The term 'Concatenative' referrers to the process of composing (by concatenating) functions (called 'words') together into a program. To make the composition of words as easy as possible, Concatenative languages simply use the space between words as the composition operator. By placing one word after another you are composing functions. This leads to the natural use of post-fix notation. Yes post-fix notation seems backwards at first, but since function composition is the most essential operation, it makes what seemed backwards straight forward again. There are a few other distinguishing properties of this language, such as all values are stored on a stack. Stack-based languages do not have an assignment operator, so they cannot store values in variable, wow that is different! Storing values on a stack gives a nice property to all words: they take one argument (the stack) and return a new stack. Pounce may be the strangest and yet easiest language you will ever learn. The challenge will be letting go of your preconceived notions of what a programming language should look like and how to go about programming.
